Consider what a non-pandas version of this code would be like
- maybe makes dependencies/maintainability easier for others
- pulling JSON data from web isn't really any harder
- writing CSVs isn't much harder
- uglier for doing things like "fetch all projects for this set of appeals"

Test upload to CKAN
 - this might need to wait on new release of CKAN?
 - I've manually uploaded at least one example of each file

Document column descriptions for each dataframe that can be returned by queries

Perhaps unify appeal vs emergency handling in script args by making users pass in kwargs?
  - appeal_id=1234 vs emergency_id=9876, or similar, then build URL based on what kwarg was used
